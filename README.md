#Welcome to OSGS  *VSTS work management project for the Universal Store team*  

Check out UST Stories and Team Dashboards for links to assorted dashboards across Universal Store.

#Administration
**Area Paths**  
Previous http://compcentral has been replaced by the Work / Areas directly in VSTS.  Use this extension to manage your Area Path at Area Level 3 and below  
  
**VSTS Teams**  
Use [VSOTeamWizard](http://vsoteamwizard) to create a VSTS team (select OSGS project)

**Iteration Paths**  
Standard across WDG, align to months, dates do not match exactly to calendar dates as Iterations are set to start on Mondays  

**Permissions**  
See [WDGAccess](http://wdgaccess), e-mail [WDGAccess](mailto:wdgaccess@microsoft.com) for support  

**Shared Query Administration**  
Delete and Move permissions for Shared Queries are managed within scoped SQAdmin* groups per team.  E-mail [USRS](mailto:usrs@microsoft.com) for more info.

**Universal Store Support**

#OSGS Expectations
**Universal Store / External Partners**   
OSGS is the work management VSTS project for Universal Store under Eric Lockard.  Every Area Path is owned or sponsored by someone in UST.  Members of UST can, but are not expected to, work in other instances or projects, and, external teams are not expected to work in OSGS unless sponsored by a UST team.    

**Story / Customer Promise / Scenario / Deliverable / Task**  
The work hierarchy is common across WDG to promote collaboration between projects - OSGS, OS, Xbox, etc.  Please see the  [WDG VSTS Taxonomy](https://osgwiki.com/wiki/WDG_VSTS_Taxonomy)for full info.  Note, in practice, not all workflows are aligned yet across WDG or even within UST.  The weekly *UST Heartbeat* meeting is focused on improving these related processes; e-mail [USRS](mailto:usrs@microsoft.com) for questions.
 
**Pri-0 Bugs**  
Bugs with Priority=0 are expected to be treated as a live site issue and resolved within 24hrs (or updated daily if issue cannot be immediately resolved).  If the issue does not warrant this level of attention, please lower the priority.   Recommendation for Priority 1 / 2 / 3 bugs is to address within the week / month / quarter respectively.    

**State**  
State=Proposed work items are considered to still be in planning or stretch goal for an iteration.  Committed or Started are expected to be delivered within their noted Iteration.

**Iteration Paths**  
Iteration Paths denote the iteration in which the work is expected to be finished.  Committed/Started work in an Iteration Path past its End Date is considered Past Due.  Use an appropriate ***Release*** value if needed to denote when the *release* of the work is different than the iteration in which it was completed. Root level OSGS is the Backlog Iteration Path.

**Area Paths**  
Area Paths at Area Level 2 denote Team ownership and are encouraged to denote SubTeam ownership at Area Level 3.  Area Paths at Area Level 4 and below are managed locally by the respective team.  
 
**Dependencies**  
Dependencies are managed at the Deliverable level within the work hierarchy.  See [Dependency Wiki page](https://osgwiki.com/wiki/Dependency)for full info.
